1) Simple Chatbot:
I implemented a Python-based chatbot with enhanced features. This chatbot includes a dynamic greeting, farewell, and responses to basic questions. It engages users by prompting them with questions, remembers context throughout the conversation, and encourages users to share more about themselves. The code handles user inputs gracefully with error handling, providing friendly responses in case of misunderstandings.
